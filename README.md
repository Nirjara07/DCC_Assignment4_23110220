### WEB DEVELOPMENT WITH FLASK
##### Task 1: Loading the PDF files and converting them to CSV using Fitz.
The given database consists of the data for electoral bonds of the 2024 elections.
It contains two files, namely:
1. Purchase Details: It contains information about when and by whom an electoral bond was purchased.
2. Redemption Details: This dataset consists of the details of the pay branch and the pay teller.

These datasets are in the form of PDFs.
To be able to perform data analysis on it, we need to convert it to .csv format. For this, I used the FITZ library.
